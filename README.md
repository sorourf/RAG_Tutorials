# # Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Techniques

Welcome to the **RAG Techniques Repository**! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.

---

## 📊 Overview

RAG combines retrieval mechanisms with generative models, enhancing tasks such as question answering, summarization, and document generation. This repository focuses on explaining, visualizing, and implementing key RAG techniques.
